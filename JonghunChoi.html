            <p>Hello everyone. I am Jonghun Choi a.k.a Jake. My favorite course is COMP1111. 
               In other words, it is 001100 011000 010110 011001 000001 000001 000001 000001
               in base 36 number system. It is very interesting number system because we can
               use numbers and alphabets combined to represent information such as V3M3R5.
               Yes, I live there. And it is a number in base 36. If you want to represent it
               in binary, it will be 011111 000011 010110 000011 011011 000101. Of course
               there are very large bits wasted because we use 36 ea numbers but in 6 bits, which
               can hold up 64 ea of numbers. But I can do it because IEEE also is doing that
               with the floating point standard, assigning bunch of NaNs. In 32 bits IEEE floating
               point standard, there are about 17 million of NaNs. Did you know it?!
               If you don't understand my words though, congratulation. You are a wonderful
               normal human being. If you understand it, congratulation. You are a geek.</p>
